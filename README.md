# Chrome OS Hack Player

## Installation

Installation for Chrome OS.

* Download ZIP from github.
* Open Zip (either double click or right click and select open).
* Drag hackplayer folder to Downloads.

## Usage Notes

Open player.html in the hackplayer folder in Downloads.

Further instructions are on the page that loads.

### Usage Notes

The videoplayer folder must be saved in your Downloads or Videos folder to work.

This is because chrome does not give a files full path and obscures the selected file path.

This "app" gets around this limitation by building the path from the page url.
