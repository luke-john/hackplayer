# Chrome OS Hack Player

## Installation

Installation for Chrome OS.

Download player from GitHub by right clicking on the below link and selecting "save link as".

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luke-john/hackplayer/master/dist/hackplayer.html

## Usage

Open hackplayer.html.

Further instructions are on the page that loads.

### Usage Notes

The player must be saved in the same folder as videos you want to watch to work.

This is because chrome does not give a files full path and obscures the selected file path.

This "app" gets around this limitation by building the path from the page url.

I recommend leaving it in your Downloads folder.
